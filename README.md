# FriendlyMobs
A very simple datapack that makes it so hostile mobs don't attack the player.

It uses the /team command to add hostile mobs onto the same team as the player, and adds the wither onto a team of its own so it won't target other things. 
It uses the NBT tag for the Ender Dragon to keep it circling and never attacking. 

Put the whole folder (excluding README) into the datapacks file of the world and run /reload.

Contact me on discord (emeveon#2780) if there are any suggestions!
